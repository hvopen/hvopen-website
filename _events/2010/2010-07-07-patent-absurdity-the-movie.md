[Patent Absurdity](http://patentabsurdity.com/) explores the case of software patents and the history of judicial activism that led to their rise, and the harm being done to software developers and the wider economy. The film is based on a series of interviews conducted during the Supreme Court's review of **in re Bilski** — a case that could have profound implications for the patenting of software. The Court's decision is due soon...

The film runs about 30 minutes.  It will be followed by a TED Talk on innovation in low IP industries, then a moderated discussion on the topics raised in the film.
