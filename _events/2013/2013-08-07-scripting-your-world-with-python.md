<img alt="python-logo" src="http://www.python.org/images/python-logo.gif" style="width: 211px; height: 71px; float: left; padding-left: 10px; " />Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively.  Python runs on Windows, Linux/Unix, Mac OS X, and has been ported to the Java and .NET virtual machines.  Python is free to use, even for commercial products, because of its OSI-approved open source license.  This talk will provide a basic overview of the Python language and explore some of the ways that you can use Python to tie together the systems showing up on your LAN and on the cloud.

Michael Muller is a software developer currently working at Google, New York.   Michael has been a member of the Python community since 1997 and a member of MHVLUG almost since its inception.
