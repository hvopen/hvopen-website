title: Overview of the Parse Backend Platform
type: meeting
---

If you are interested in an open source, scalable app backend that
requires almost no code, setup, or maintenance, you should check out
Parse. Parse is a backend-as-a-service that is now open source. Chris
has used it on several projects, and he will give an overview of the
platform. He’ll talk about how it compares to alternatives such as
Firebase or AWS. And he’ll spice it up with a live coding demo that
will almost certainly to fail due to typos, misconfiguration, bad
network, or a combination of all of the above. You’ll experience the
schadenfreude of watching someone agonize trying to get a simple code
demo, that had worked just minutes before, to work again live in front
of an audience of other developers!
