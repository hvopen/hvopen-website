title: Rebuilding the airplane in flight... safely
type: meeting
---

In 2017, NS1 embarked on a ground-up rewrite of its advanced DNS
server software. This required significant research, planning, and
execution time—over a year in total. Shannon Weyrick details the
various challenges NS1 encountered and key points the company had to
consider to successfully engineer and deploy across its global managed
DNS network with no negative impact or downtime to its customers.

Shannon shares background on the decision to move forward with a
rewrite (including DNSSEC and scaling requirements), research of
appropriate technologies to balance performance, functionality, and
engineering velocity, phased milestones with a hybrid release approach
to better facilitate product iteration and to gain operational
experience, a system for tee-testing traffic for verification of
correctness during deploy, and the utilization of an anycast network
for fault isolation during roll out. Along the way, Shannon discusses
the many minor successes, failures, setbacks, and delays that you may
face day to day and offers tips and advice to support you in your own
quests to rebuild your airplanes in flight. You’ll leave with an
appreciation for the challenges involved in planning and executing a
large-scale rewrite and deployment of critical path software across a
widely distributed network.

### Pizza! ###

For the December meeting we're going to try something new. Instead of
going to the Palace for Dinner after we're going to do
Pay-it-forward-Pizza at the meeting itself. All are welcome to have
Pizza, and we'll be collecting funds to pay-it-forward for future
meetings. After the meeting we'll head to a local Poughkeepsie area
bar for a holiday drink or two.

### Lightning Talks ###

We'll also be doing the
following [lightning talks](/lightning-talks.html) before the meeting:

* Report from Mini Maker Fair - Sean Swelha
* What's coming in RHEL8 - Pat Ladd
* Room for one more, please propose below!
