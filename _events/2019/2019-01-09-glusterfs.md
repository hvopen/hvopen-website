title: GlusterFS - Open source software defined storage
type: meeting
---

![Gluster Logo](/images/talks/gluster.svg)
[GlusterFS](https://www.gluster.org/) is a scalable network filesystem suitable for data-intensive tasks such as cloud storage and media streaming. GlusterFS is free and open source software and can utilize common off-the-shelf hardware.

We'll go over the basic terminology, Gluster features and architecture, and then do a demo of configuring and using (and abusing) Gluster.
