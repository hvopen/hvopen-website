title: 'Everything is on fire, everything is fine: investigating data breaches'
type: meeting

What happens when your corporate security is breached? Your file server and backup server have been encrypted by ransomware. An attacker breaches your accounting departmentâ€™s email accounts and re-routes a $200,000 wire transfer to Hong Kong. Your next-gen firewall is showing waves of malware outbreaks in your environment.
This will be a discussion of how those types of breaches are investigated, what evidence is used to find the root cause, and how you can protect your company from the most common types of breaches.
This talk will be interactive. Audience members will be presented with puzzles and obstacles encountered during real investigations.
