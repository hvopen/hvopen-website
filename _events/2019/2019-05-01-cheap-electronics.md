title: Making Electronics on the Cheap
type: meeting
---

The Golden Age of Hardware Hacking brings a cornucopia of electronic
test equipment and components, bearing specifications from yesterday's
lab-grade hardware with price tags from today's Happy Meal, direct to
your workbench from halfway around the planet.

This presentation will review electrical units, then explore how to
produce signals and measure circuit properties, covering everything
from power supplies to function generators, multimeters to
oscilloscopes, and even a few instruments you've never met before.

You'll also learn why "Trust, but Verify" remains relevant, especially
for deals both "too good to be true" and "too good to pass up".

### Speaker ###

Ed Nisley began making widgets long before Making was a thing, writing
decades of magazine article and columns helping engineers and Makers
avoid his oopsies. He's worked for a locally important Three Letter
Company, done the consulting engineer gig, and has happily retired to
his Basement Laboratory.
