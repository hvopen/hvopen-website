![Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/hubfs/red-hat-ansible_black.svg)

Are you still configuring systems from the command line? Why? [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com)
is an agent-less automation tool that can automate the setup and
maintenance of your computer systems (Linux _and_ Windows) as well as
a growing variety of network devices and basically any other system with ssh.
Stop building artisinal servers and start building your infrastructure
with code.

We'll go over basic Ansible concepts, get you going with some playbooks,
and touch on Ansible roles, explore Ansible Galaxy, and then
go into larger deployments using
[Ansible AWX](https://www.ansible.com/products/awx-project/faq)
(the upstream project for Red Hat Ansible Tower) with scheduling, history, and RBAC
