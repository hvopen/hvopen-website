Ansible is an open-source software provisioning, configuration 
management, and application deployment tool. Designed for 
multi-tier deployments since day one, Ansible models your IT 
infrastructure by describing how all of your systems inter-relate, 
rather than just managing one system at a time.

It uses no agents and no additional custom security infrastructure, 
so it's easy to deploy - and most importantly, it uses a very 
simple language (YAML, in the form of Ansible Playbooks) that allow 
you to describe your automation jobs in a way that approaches plain 
English.
