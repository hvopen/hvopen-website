title: Past, Present, and Future of Rails at GitHub
type: meeting
---
On August 15, 2018 GitHub was deployed to production running Rails 5.2. 
This was a historic event; for years GitHub had been behind Rails and 
dependent on a custom fork of Rails 2.3. This talk will visit GitHub’s 
past, including our tumultuous relationship with the Rails framework, 
and the grueling effort it took to get our application on the latest 
version.

You’ll learn what mistakes to avoid and the reasons why such a 
difficult upgrade was worth it. We’ll explore what tracking master 
means for the future and establish that GitHub and Rails are in it 
together for the long haul.
