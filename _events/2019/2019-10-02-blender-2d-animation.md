title: Blender 2.80 and 2D Animation
type: meeting
---

The release of Blender 2.80 brought many improvements including templates and workspaces 
for different tasks, gestured pie menus for certain actions, and the novice friendly left 
click select. There was also a great deal of development that went into the Grease Pencil 
tool.

This meeting will focus on using Blender to create 2D animations as well as cover some of 
the other major changes to the interface.
