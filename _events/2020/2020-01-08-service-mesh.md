title: Next Level Cloud Development with Service Mesh
title_image: /images/talks/istio.gif
---
Now that the first generations of micro service applications have deployed, some of the difficulties with developing and maintaining these applications have become apparent especially as these increase in complexity.  The service mesh is one of the responses to those difficulties that will benefit the next generation of applications.  The service mesh provides basic discovery, load balancing, failure recovery, metrics, and monitoring services to the services within an application, as well as more advanced features such as A/B testing, canary rollouts, rate limiting, access control, and end-to-end authentication.

A collection of projects come together to offer mesh capabilities:
* Configurable interconnect of services via Istio
* Tracing and measurement via Jaeger
* Visualization via Kiali
