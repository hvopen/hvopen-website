title: 'Everyday Pandas for Totally not Data Scientists'
type: meeting
---
When considering the field of data science, Pandas is the de-facto tool in everyone's toolbox. But can it be used for general business data wrangling?
In this talk, we will explore a handful of use cases where Pandas is used in a business environment, instead of a data science environment, and how it can be used in conjunction with, and in some cases in place of, traditional SQL databases.
We will also explore supporting libraries and tools that are frequently used in conjunction with Pandas.
