When creating modern software, we often are lured into the latest and
greatest new trends in software development. However, very often our
old and reliable tools can provide us just as successful a path to
success. And one of the most old and reliable tools is the humble SQL
database.

This talk will look at the rebuilding of the scheduler / queue system
for the IBM Quantum Experience, moving all the data from noSQL systems
to PostgreSQL to get much better reliability, performance, and enable
new features. It will look at a whole series of performance cliffs we
hit as we grew the system, and how we got past them.

You'll walk away learning things that PostgreSQL can do that you
probably didn't realize, and how you can take advantage of those to
build high performance applications.
