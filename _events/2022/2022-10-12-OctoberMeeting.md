Ceph - Open Source Software-defined Distributed Storage

Ceph is a flexible, scalable, high performance network storage system providing block, object, and file storage. 
Using a cluster of vendor and hardware indepedent devices, it provides all the features demanded by modern and legacy 
storage use cases. Learn more about it's architecture and implementation, as well as how to install and run a cluster. 
We'll also cover OpenShift Data Foundation, which is a containerized version of Ceph that runs on OpenShift clusters 
providing hyperconverged storage for OpenShift.
