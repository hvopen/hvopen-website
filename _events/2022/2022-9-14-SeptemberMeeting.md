CLIs in Python with Click

Jim Kutter has been infatuated with computers since his early days on the Apple IIc, and Mac Classic, 
before making the switch to PCs in the early 90s. He's contributed to several open source projects over 
the years, including SDL. In 2001 he discovered Python and fell in love, despite a real life aversion to 
snakes. He lives in Hopewell Junction with his wife of 22 years and their three children, three cats and 
11 chickens. He can be reached at https://jimkutter.com
