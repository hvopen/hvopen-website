<H2>Main Talk: Josh Kornblat: Data wrangling with R</H2>

Josh presented many of the aspects of working with data using “R” - a <A href="https://www.r-project.org/about.html">language</A> that allows for reasonably easy ways of working with statistical information.

Attendees were able to follow along with the examples Josh illustrated. He illustrated how data was easily organised and presented in numerical or chart forms.

A short illustration of some of the things you can do with R was given by referencing <A href="http://graphicacy.com">Graphicacy</A>, a group that makes wall charts based on data analysis using R.
