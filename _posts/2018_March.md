## LT1: Matthias Johnson - Blender

## LT2: Joseph Apuzzo - Youtube Download

## LT3: David Miller - XDP and the Future of Networking

## LT4: Mike Muller - A Software Mellotron

## LT5: Ed Nisley - Nine Years of Tech Blogging

## LT6: Sean Dague - FastMail and Selenium

Finally, there was Official Conversion of the group from MHVLUG to HVOpen and history of the group's 15 years from Sean Dague.
Thanks once again to Patrick Ladd for the 15th Anniversary Cake!
