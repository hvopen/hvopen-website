# Lightning Talk
## LT1: Joe Apuzzo - MicroPython on a [Tiny Board](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/ESP32-ESP-32-ESP-32S-ESP32S-For-WeMos-Mini-D1-LOLIN32-Wifi-Bluetooth-Wireless-Board-Module/32840971102.html)
Joe has obtained a Development board that was loaded with a version of Python called MicroPython. In a very quick demo, he illustrated linking to the board through WiFi and using a short set of Python commands to set an indicator light on the board - wirelessly. There is a lot more this little board can do - and for $6 from eBay, it could be lots of fun.
# Main Talk: Dan Stone - Kubernetes
Dan presented some background to Kubernetes, as well as an overview of the difference between Virtual Machine systems 
and Containers.

Kubernetes core concepts of the Pod, Deployment, Service and Secret were examined in some detail,
and information regarding Config Map, Replication Controller, Jobs and Ingress were quickly mentioned but "left for later" as far as details.

Dan began a live Kubernetes session, then illustrated how the system could examine resources and distribute new Pods appropriately across resources available, appropriately.

Dan took questions both during the presentation and after - and as a slight amusement, found a Minecraft visualisation of containers in a YouTube video.
