      HV Open's mission is to create a space for sharing about open
      technologies. Our world is complicated, and software and data
      science becomes a more important part of it every day. Open
      Technologies such as open source, open data, open hardware, and
      others are an important part of empowering users.
    </p>
    <p>
      Open Technologies are also much better for learning. Being able
      to open the hood and see the insides of complex systems helps us
      understand more about the world.

    <p>
      HV Open started as the Mid Hudson Valley Linux Users Group
      (MHVLUG) in 2003, with our first meeting in March of that
      year. During the early years the focus was on connecting Linux
      users to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2018, at the 15th Anniversary meeting the group was rebranded
      HV Open.
